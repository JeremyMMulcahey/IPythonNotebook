Directory for Notebooks and associated files from my projects at Cal Poly.

The TimeSeries notebooks consist of homework assignments from the quarter and the final portfolio. The portfolio can be viewed/navigated through the table of contents "TOC.ipynb" (http://bit.ly/1skpfJb).

The SeniorProject notebooks consist of my Senior Project (http://bit.ly/1zqK5hj) and Presentation (http://bit.ly/1oDTuOJ). The introduction to the project can be found in "Chapter 1" (http://bit.ly/1Ddz3z0). The presentation can be viewed/navigated through "Presentation.ipynb" (http://bit.ly/1oDTuOJ).
