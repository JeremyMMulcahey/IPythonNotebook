      "My notes about this project from my first meeting with Dr. Doi have various scribbles relating to web apps, dynamic data, comparing R & SAS with Python, and, of course, using python for data analysis. While working on the project, I felt I would never reach this point. Every time I sat down to work on a section, I came up with another idea we could explore. Letting some ideas go and accepting that we might only scratch the surface on other ideas was a challenge in its own right. My hope is that we went deep enough to show readers what Python can do and motivate them to attempt similar work - one step ahead of where I left off. There should be enough tips, tricks, and failures in this notebook to save students from repeating my mistakes."
