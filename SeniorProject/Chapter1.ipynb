Working in the IPython Notebook enables users to write code, analyze data in Python and R, format using LaTeX and HTML, and produce plots within a single document. The notebooks can be converted to HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and other formats. The notebooks can also be shared, stored, and backed up using NBViewer and GitHub."

The NIST previously analyzed each dataset and provides the type of analysis, certified graphics, and a corresponding set of certified values. After analyzing each dataset in Python, R, and SAS with the recommended data analysis technique (regression, ANOVA, or Univariate statistical summary), the output values from each of the 3 programs are compared to one another and compared to the NIST certified values to determine the precision of their calculations. Additionally, the NIST certified graphics are replicated to introduce some of Python's basic visualization techniques."
